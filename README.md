# **The History of React**

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used to create single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. In this article, we will explore the origins and evolution of React, and how it became one of the most influential front-end technologies in the web development world.


## **The Birth of React**

React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Meta, who was inspired by XHP, an HTML component library for PHP. He wanted to create a better way to manage the complex and dynamic user interfaces of Facebook’s applications. He built a prototype called “FaxJS” that allowed him to write HTML-like syntax in JavaScript and render it to the DOM using a virtual DOM abstraction. He showed his prototype to his colleagues and received positive feedback. He then decided to turn it into a library that could be used by other developers at Meta.

React was first deployed on Facebook’s News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012. It was officially announced at the JSConf US in May 2013 by Tom Occhino and Pete Hunt. They demonstrated how React could simplify the development of large-scale applications with declarative and composable components. They also introduced JSX, a syntax extension that allows writing HTML elements in JavaScript. JSX was initially met with skepticism by some developers, but it soon became widely adopted as a convenient way to express UI elements in React.


## **The Growth of React**

React quickly gained popularity among web developers, especially after it was open-sourced in March 2015. Many developers appreciated its simplicity, performance, and flexibility. React also inspired many other libraries and frameworks, such as Angular, Vue, Svelte, and Preact, that adopted some of its concepts and features.

React also expanded its scope beyond the web platform. In 2015, Meta released React Native, a framework that allows building native mobile applications using React. React Native uses the same component-based approach as React, but renders to native UI elements instead of the DOM. React Native enabled developers to share code and skills across web and mobile platforms, and create consistent and high-quality user experiences.

In 2016, Meta introduced React VR, a framework that allows building virtual reality applications using React. React VR leverages the power of WebGL and WebVR to render immersive 3D scenes in the browser. React VR also uses the same component-based approach as React, but renders to VR devices instead of the DOM. React VR enabled developers to create engaging and interactive VR experiences with minimal effort.


## **The Future of React**

React continues to evolve and improve as a library for building user interfaces. Some of the recent developments and trends in React are:



* **Concurrent Mode**: A set of features that enable React to render components asynchronously and interruptibly, improving the responsiveness and user experience of complex applications.
* **Hooks**: A new way to write function components that can use state and other React features without using class components or higher-order components.
* **Suspense**: A feature that allows components to suspend rendering while they wait for data or code to be fetched, showing fallback UI elements instead.
* **Server Components**: An experimental feature that allows rendering components on the server-side and streaming them to the client-side, reducing bundle size and improving performance.
* **React 18**: The upcoming major version of React that will include concurrent mode, suspense, server components, and other improvements.

React has come a long way since its inception in 2011. It has revolutionized the way we build user interfaces for the web and beyond. It has also created a vibrant and diverse community of developers who contribute to its development and innovation. React is not only a library, but also a philosophy and a culture that values simplicity, composition, and user experience.
